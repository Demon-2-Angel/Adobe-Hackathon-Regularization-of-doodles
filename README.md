# Curve Regularization, Symmetry Exploration, and Completion of Doodles

## Objective

This project focuses on three key objectives:
1. **Regularizing Curves:** Identify and distinguish regular shapes (like lines, circles, ellipses, etc.) from irregular curves.
2. **Exploring Symmetry in Curves:** Identify reflection symmetry in closed shapes and fit Bézier curves to symmetrical points.
3. **Completing Incomplete Curves:** Develop algorithms to complete curves with missing parts, handling varying levels of shape occlusion.

## Approach

### 1. Regularizing Curves

#### Objective
Identify and distinguish regular shapes from irregular curves.

#### Approach
- **Curve Fitting:**
  - Use curve fitting techniques (e.g., least squares) to approximate curves as simple geometric shapes.
  - For straight lines, use linear regression.
  - For circles and ellipses, use parametric equations to fit the curves.
  - For polygons, detect vertices and analyze angles and lengths to regularize.
- **Shape Matching:**
  - Compare extracted features (e.g., radius for circles, aspect ratio for ellipses) with predefined criteria for each shape type.
  - Use algorithms like the Hough Transform for detecting straight lines and circles.
- **Validation:**
  - Test the algorithm on various images to check for accuracy in identifying regular shapes.

### 2. Exploring Symmetry in Curves

#### Objective
Identify reflection symmetry in closed shapes and fit Bézier curves to symmetrical points.

#### Approach
- **Symmetry Detection:**
  - Identify the axis of symmetry by analyzing pairs of points on the curve and checking for equidistance from a potential axis.
  - Use reflection and rotational symmetry techniques.
- **Point Transformation:**
  - Convert curves into a set of points and analyze their symmetry.
  - For reflection symmetry, check if pairs of points exist across a line of symmetry.
- **Bézier Curve Fitting:**
  - Use Bézier curve fitting techniques to represent symmetric points.
  - Fit identical Bézier curves to each pair of symmetric points and ensure the curve is smooth and continuous.

### 3. Completing Incomplete Curves

#### Objective
Develop algorithms to complete curves with missing parts, handling varying levels of shape occlusion.

#### Approach
- **Curve Continuity:**
  - Analyze the continuity of the curve by detecting edges and contours.
  - Use spline interpolation or Bézier curve fitting to extend or connect the incomplete sections.
- **Occlusion Handling:**
  - For fully contained shapes, use extrapolation to predict the missing part.
  - For partially contained shapes, use geometric continuity (G1 or G2 continuity) to smoothly connect the curve.
  - For disconnected shapes, use pattern recognition or machine learning to infer the missing segments.
- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Test on various occluded images, starting from simple gaps to more complex occlusions.
  - Validate the algorithm's ability to naturally complete the curve without abrupt transitions.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Programming Languages:** Python with libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy.
- **Mathematical Techniques:** Curve fitting, interpolation, regression analysis.
- **Algorithms:** Hough Transform, Bézier curve fitting, symmetry detection algorithms.

## Next Steps

- Break down each task into smaller, manageable components.
- Start by developing simple scripts or functions for each sub-task.
- Test each function with sample data before integrating them into a full algorithm.
- Document your progress and results to refine your approach.
